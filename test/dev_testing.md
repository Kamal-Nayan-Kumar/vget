# Developer Testing Guide

This guide is for the **Developer** laptop. You will act as the creator of a software package and publish it to the remote secure repository.

## 1. Install the CLI & Connect to Cloud

You can view the published packages on the frontend website: [https://vget-teal.vercel.app/](https://vget-teal.vercel.app/)

Download the pre-compiled binary for your operating system from the GitHub Releases page:
[https://github.com/Kamal-Nayan-Kumar/vget/releases/latest](https://github.com/Kamal-Nayan-Kumar/vget/releases/latest)

Extract the downloaded file and open your terminal in that folder.

### 🍎 Mac / 🐧 Linux (Terminal)
```bash
# Make the binary executable (replace with your downloaded file name)
chmod +x vget-linux-amd64   # or vget-macos-amd64 / vget-macos-arm64

# Set up aliases and point to the cloud backend
export VGET="./vget-linux-amd64" 
export VGET_API_URL="https://vget-backend.onrender.com"
```

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Set up aliases and point to the cloud backend
$env:VGET=".\vget-windows-amd64.exe"
$env:VGET_API_URL="https://vget-backend.onrender.com"
```

## 2. Setup Identity

To avoid conflicts with previous tests, we will clear old local keys and use a unique username.

### 🍎 Mac / 🐧 Linux (Terminal)
```bash
# Clear old keys and generate new Ed25519 keypair
rm -rf ~/.vget
$VGET keygen

# Register a unique account and upgrade to Developer
export DEV_USER="dev_$(date +%s)"
$VGET register --username "$DEV_USER" --password "secure123"
$VGET login --username "$DEV_USER" --password "secure123"
$VGET dev-register --username "$DEV_USER"
```

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Clear old keys and generate new Ed25519 keypair
if (Test-Path ~/.vget) { Remove-Item -Recurse -Force ~/.vget }
& $env:VGET keygen

# Register a unique account and upgrade to Developer
$DEV_USER="dev_$([math]::Floor([datetimeOffset]::UtcNow.ToUnixTimeSeconds()))"
& $env:VGET register --username "$DEV_USER" --password "secure123"
& $env:VGET login --username "$DEV_USER" --password "secure123"
& $env:VGET dev-register --username "$DEV_USER"
```

## 3. Test & Publish the Quiz Package

Test the software locally first to ensure it works properly, then publish it. Publishing will automatically compress the folder, generate a SHA256 checksum, sign the checksum with your private key, and upload the payload to the server.

### 🍎 Mac / 🐧 Linux (Terminal)
```bash
# Test the quiz locally
python ../data-security-quiz/quiz.py

# Publish to the live backend
$VGET publish --path ../data-security-quiz --version 1.0.0
```

### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)
```powershell
# Test the quiz locally
python ../data-security-quiz/quiz.py

# Publish to the live backend
& $env:VGET publish --path ../data-security-quiz --version 1.0.0
```

---

**Success!** If the backend ML scanner detects no threats, your package is now live. Give the package name `data-security-quiz` to the "User" laptop to test the installation.

> **Note on Windows (.exe):** 
> Do **not** double-click the `vget-windows-amd64.exe` file! It is a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool. If you double-click it, a black window will flash for a split second and close immediately because it expects terminal arguments. You must run it from inside your PowerShell terminal using the `.\` or `&` syntax shown above.

## 4. Run the ML Security Scanner (Optional but Recommended)

Before publishing, it is highly recommended to run the ML Code Checker locally to ensure your code does not contain any security vulnerabilities or obfuscated payloads that would cause the backend to reject your package.

### How to test your package:
```bash
# Ensure your virtual environment is active
source .venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to the ml_scanner directory
cd ../ml_scanner

# Run the scanner against your package folder
python main.py ../data-security-quiz
```

You should see a `SECURITY SCAN REPORT` with a "REVIEW" or "PASS" decision and a low risk score (e.g., < 30).

### How to test a malicious package (Demo):
We have included a dummy malicious package folder at `test/malicious_test` which contains shell injections and obfuscated base64 payloads to demonstrate how the ML Scanner catches bad actors.

```bash
# Run the scanner against the malicious demo package
cd ml_scanner
python main.py ../test/malicious_test
```
You will see it immediately flag `[HIGH] Shell injection risk` and `[MEDIUM] Encoded payload detected`, generating a high risk score and a "WARN" or "REJECT" decision.
