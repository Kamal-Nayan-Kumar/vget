Maps a numeric risk score to a CI/CD action decision.

Thresholds
──────────
  score >= 75  →  BLOCK   (critical risk — do not deploy)
  score >= 45  →  WARN    (significant risk — human review recommended)
  score >= 20  →  REVIEW  (low–moderate risk — flag for awareness)
  score <  20  →  ALLOW   (acceptable risk — proceed)
